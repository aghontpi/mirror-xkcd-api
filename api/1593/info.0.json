We're on part 5 of a hitting game.\n\nBeret Guy: The next guy has a big bat, so he'll probably hit the ball real far.   huh?\n{{\n-\nWait- he missed! \n-\nOh good, they're letting him try again.\n\nBeret Guy: The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy, but he's ignoring them. Wow. \n-\nRude.\n\nBeret Guy: This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them. \n-\nIt's just him though. None of his teammates are joining in.\n\nBeret Guy: That guy just ran to the second pillow when no one was looking! \n-\nEveryone's real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there's nothing that says he can't do that.  \n-\nYikes. Hopefully they can fix that once this game is over.\n\n{{Title text: The thrower started hitting the bats too much, so the king of the game told him to leave and brought out another thrower from thrower jail.}}", "alt": "The thrower started hitting the bats too much, so the king of the game told him to leave and brought out another thrower from thrower jail.", "img": "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/play_by_play.png", "title": "Play-By-Play", "day": "21", "mirror_img": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aghontpi/mirror-xkcd-api/main/api/1593/play_by_play.png"}
