Readers were also invited to submit dialog options for trees where there were not yet 4 fixed options, thus growing the potential story space. As such there is no fixed transcript for this comic.))\n\n{{Title text: Every choice, no matter how small, begins a new story.}}", "alt": "Every choice, no matter how small, begins a new story.", "img": "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/shouldnt_be_hard.png", "title": "Lorenz", "extra_parts": {"pre": "", "headerextra": "\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/1350/bernardo.css\" type=\"text/css\">\n", "inset": "\n<script src=\"/s/b66ed7.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/1350/bernardo.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nBernardo.comic({el: $('#comic')})\n</script>", "post": "\n", "imgAttr": ""}, "day": "1", "mirror_img": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aghontpi/mirror-xkcd-api/main/api/1350/shouldnt_be_hard.png"}
